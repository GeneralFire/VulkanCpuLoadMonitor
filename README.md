# Vulkan based Cpu Usage Monitor

## Min requirements:
* MS Visual Studio>=2015

## How to install:
1. Install GLSL extension for VS (step might be skipped for simple compile+run);  
2. Ctrl+B to build ;)
3. Ctrl+F5 to run.

## Dependencies:
* [glfw-3.3.6](https://www.glfw.org/) - Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop.
* [glm-0.9.9.8](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.
* [Vulkan SDK 1.3.204.0](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) - a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern graphics processing units

> All dependencies included in **dependencies** folder.

## Limitation:
* x64 platform support only.

## Troubleshooting:
* For VS!=2017 you might should change path to *glfw* library. Default solution uses *lib-vc2017*.
